In the world of data security, encryption is like a fortress protecting sensitive information from prying eyes. Among the many encryption methods, there's one called the Transposition Cipher. It's a bit like rearranging the letters of a word to make it look scrambled. 

I wrote a blog post about the project, you can find it [here](https://azarmamiyev.me/blogs/transposition_cipher/) and also you can find project on GitHub by clicking [here](https://github.com/heyitsazar/ascii_encryption_basics).
