# Abstract
This was a project aimed at teaching a group of students with little to no background knowledge about the fundamental workings of IoT devices, in theory 1 and in practice. Practical exercises included: a basic "hello world!" program, LED and button usage example, timer and process explanation examples, sensor data reading examples, generic and ADC port usage examples, client and server communication examples, basics of security and its testing, MQTT communication basics. Most of these were explored without any obstacles-all but one of them (which prevented the continuation of a particular experiment) were overcome.
